# Problemset Example

```{r include=FALSE}

# To check your solutions in RStudio save (Ctrl-S) and then run all chunks (Ctrl-Alt-R)

# Note: You must use / instead of \ to separate folders
ps.dir =  'D:/libraries/RTutor/RTutor/vignettes/problemsets' # the folder in which this file is stored
ps.file = 'Example.Rmd' # this file
user.name = 'ENTER A USER NAME HERE' # your user name


library(RTutor)
library(AER)
check.problem.set('Example', ps.dir, ps.file, user.name=user.name, reset=FALSE)
```

Name: `r user.name`
## Exercise 1 -- Summary statistics ###########################

a) We often want to compute some summary statistic of a vector.
For example:

```{r "1 a)"}
x = 10:20
# Computing the sum of x
sum(x)
```

Now compute the mean of x.

```{r "1 a) 2"}
# enter your code here ...
```
